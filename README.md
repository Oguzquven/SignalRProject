ðŸ“¡ SignalR Project â€“ Real-Time Notification and Messaging System
This project is a real-time notification and messaging system developed using ASP.NET Core and SignalR. The SignalR technology establishes a bi-directional communication channel between the server and the client, enabling instant data transfer.

With this project, users can send instant messages, receive notifications, and track interactions in real time without delays. The WebSocket protocol allows requests from the browser to be sent directly to the server, and users can see the latest updates without refreshing the page.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
This project utilizes modern web technologies:

âœ… Backend (Server-Side)
ASP.NET Core 7.0 â€“ Web API development
SignalR â€“ Real-time communication protocol
Entity Framework Core â€“ ORM and database management
MSSQL (SQL Server) â€“ Database infrastructure
C# and LINQ â€“ Backend logic
Dependency Injection (DI) â€“ Dependency management
âœ… Frontend (Client-Side)
JavaScript (Vanilla JS / AJAX) â€“ Dynamic interactions
HTML & CSS â€“ Page structure and styling
Bootstrap 5 â€“ Responsive UI

ðŸŽ¯ Project Features
âœ” Real-Time Notification Delivery â€“ Users receive real-time notifications from the system.
